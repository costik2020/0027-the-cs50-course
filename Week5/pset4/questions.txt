0.  JPEG  a couple of millions colorts and GIF 255 colors
1.  GIF supports animation
2.  JPEG is lossy format BMP is lossless format 
3.  JPEG
4.  Tehnicaly the information is still there but the OS forgets where in memory it is
5.  Overwrrite the infortion with other information or use a dumy 0000 and 111 software
6.  stdint containts the integer data types useful for porting the program from one 
system to another
7.  We make sure that the sisze of the integer is signed or unsigned
By doing so we can use more positive numbers with unsigned numbers and soo on 
It is useful tu be exac how many bites we use because other systems use more or less bites
8. BYTE=1byte DWORD=4bytes LONG=4bytes WORD=2bytes
9.  0x42 0x4D same as BM
10. biSize is BITMAPINFOHEADERR size and bfSize is BITMAPFILEHEADER size
11. If biHeight is negative the information of the cammera wrrote the data 
from top to bottom and if it was positive that meanst the informatin is bottom -up
12. biBitCount is bits Per Pixel
13. If the file doesn't exist on disk ... fopen will return NULL
14. Is 1 byte at the time that is why fread has 1 there 
15. 3
16. fseek() Moves the controler over a number of bytes in the working file 
17. SEEK_CUR is the curent position of the controler ... where i point right now 
18. TODO
